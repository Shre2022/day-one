5 expectations from Me about _nology -

I would like _nology to be supportive and provide on time feedbacks on my work.

I would expect _nology to take a wholistic approach beyond coding (non-coding aspect) and help thrive me as a person.

I like to take step by step approach, would appreciate to be patient with me please, as coding is new to me!

I prefer to look at success according to my achievements and where I come from.

I expect to gain a fair undertanding about programming languages to help me build some projects to showcase my work and enhance the chances of career-transition.
